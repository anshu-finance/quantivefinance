                <img src="blog-images/tvm-hero.jpg" alt="Time Value of Money Concept" class="blog-img">

                <p>Imagine you have ₹1,000 today. Would you rather have ₹1,000 in your pocket right now, or receive the same ₹1,000 a year from now?</p>

                <p>If your instinct says "now," you've already understood the foundation of <strong>Time Value of Money (TVM)</strong>—a fundamental principle in finance that every smart person should know.</p>

                <h2>What Is Time Value of Money? (The Real Deal)</h2>
                <p>Time Value of Money is a simple truth: <strong>Money you have today is worth more than the same amount of money you receive in the future.</strong></p>

                <p>Why? Because money in your hand today can work for you. You can use it, invest it, or save it to earn more. But money you get later? You lose out on all the opportunities you could have used it for today.</p>

                <img src="blog-images/tvm-banana.jpg" alt="Today vs Tomorrow Concept" class="blog-img">

                <p>Think of it like this: If someone offers you a banana today or promises you a banana next week, which would you pick? The banana today, right? You can eat it now. But if you wait, you've lost a whole week of enjoying that banana—and it might even go bad. That's exactly how money works.</p>

                <h2>The Three Big Reasons Money Today Is Better</h2>

                <h3>1. Inflation (Things Get Expensive)</h3>
                <p>This is the most relatable reason money loses value over time.</p>
                
                <img src="blog-images/tvm-inflation.jpg" alt="Inflation Effect" class="blog-img">

                <p>Let's say your favourite coffee costs ₹100 today. Next year, due to inflation, that same coffee might cost ₹103. Your ₹100 buys you less tomorrow than it buys you today. In India, historical inflation averages mean your money loses purchasing power if it sits idle.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Real example:</strong> If you earned ₹10,000 and didn't do anything with it for 5 years, you'd lose purchasing power. That ₹10,000 would buy you less items than it would today.
                </div>

                <h3>2. Opportunity Cost (Money Can Grow)</h3>
                <p>This is where things get exciting. If you have money today, you can put it to work—like in a savings account or investments.</p>

                <img src="blog-images/tvm-opportunity.jpg" alt="Opportunity Cost" class="blog-img">

                <p>In India, even a basic savings account earning 3% annually gives you ₹300 in your pocket after one year on a ₹10,000 deposit. If you wait a year to receive the money, you lose that free ₹300. That's your opportunity cost.</p>

                <h3>3. Risk (Life Happens)</h3>
                <p>A promise to pay you money later is riskier than money in your hand today. The person promising might forget, move away, or simply run out of money. Today's ₹1,000 is guaranteed; tomorrow's is not.</p>

                <img src="blog-images/tvm-risk.jpg" alt="Risk Factor" class="blog-img">

                <h2>Let's See This in Action: Real Examples</h2>
                
                <h3>Example 1: Your Birthday Gift</h3>
                <p>Your parents ask: "Should we give you ₹5,000 now or ₹5,000 on your birthday in 3 months?" You pick now. Put it in a savings account, and in 3 months you have roughly ₹5,044. Plus, you have the freedom to use it if an emergency strikes.</p>

                <h3>Example 2: Starting to Save Early (The Superpower)</h3>
                <p>This is where Time Value of Money becomes life-changing.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Start at 20, save ₹1,000/month for 10 years, then stop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Start at 30, save for 25 years.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Result? Scenario A often wins because early money had MORE TIME to grow.</p>

                <h2>The Formula Behind the Magic</h2>
                <p>When money sits and earns interest, it compounds. Here's the basic visual:</p>
                
                <img src="blog-images/tvm-compound.jpg" alt="Compound Growth Formula" class="blog-img">

                <p><strong>Future Money = Today's Money × (1 + Growth Rate)^(Number of Years)</strong></p>
                <p>That extra value comes from nothing but TIME and growth. Magic? No—just math working in your favour.</p>

                <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
                <p>Time Value of Money simply means: ₹1 today is worth more than ₹1 tomorrow. Understanding this one concept is why rich people start investing early and why banks charge interest.</p>

                <img src="blog-images/tvm-cta.jpg" alt="Start Investing Today" class="blog-img">

                <p><strong>Your Turn:</strong> Think about a decision you've delayed—like starting to save or investing your first ₹1,000. Start today. Don't let the Time Value of Money work against you.</p>
