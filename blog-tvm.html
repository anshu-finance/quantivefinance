<p>Imagine you have ₹1,000 today. Would you rather have ₹1,000 in your pocket right now, or receive the same ₹1,000 a year from now?</p>

<p>If your instinct says "now," you've already understood the foundation of <strong>Time Value of Money (TVM)</strong>—a fundamental principle in finance that every smart person should know.</p>

<h2>What Is Time Value of Money?</h2>

<p>Time Value of Money is a simple truth: <strong>Money you have today is worth more than the same amount of money you receive in the future.</strong></p>

<p>Why? Because money in your hand today can work for you. You can use it, invest it, or save it to earn more.</p>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-banana.jpg.png" alt="Banana Analogy">

<p>Think of it like this: If someone offers you a banana today or promises you a banana next week, which would you pick? The banana today! You can eat it now. But if you wait, you've lost a whole week—and it might even go bad.</p>

<h2>The Three Big Reasons Money Today Is Better</h2>

<h3>1. Inflation (Things Get Expensive)</h3>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-inflation.jpg.png" alt="Coffee Inflation">

<p>Your favourite coffee costs ₹100 today. Next year, due to inflation, that same coffee might cost ₹103. Your ₹100 buys you less tomorrow than it buys you today.</p>

<div class="example-card">
<h4>💡 Real Example</h4>
<p>If you earned ₹10,000 and didn't do anything with it for 5 years, you'd lose purchasing power. That ₹10,000 would buy you less than it would today.</p>
</div>

<h3>2. Opportunity Cost (Money Can Grow)</h3>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-opportunity.jpg.png" alt="Opportunity Cost">

<p>If you have money today, you can put it to work—like in a savings account earning 3-7% annually. Even ₹10,000 earning 3% gives you ₹300 extra after one year, without doing anything.</p>

<div class="tip-box">
<p>If someone asks you to wait a year for ₹10,000 instead of receiving it today, you're losing that ₹300. That's your <strong>opportunity cost</strong>—the profit you missed out on.</p>
</div>

<h3>3. Risk (Life Happens)</h3>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-risk.jpg.png" alt="Risk">

<p>A promise to pay you money later is riskier than money in your hand today. Today's ₹1,000 is guaranteed; tomorrow's is not.</p>
<h2>Real Examples</h2>

<div class="example-card">
<h4>Example 1: Your Birthday Gift</h4>
<p>Your parents ask: "Should we give you ₹5,000 now or ₹5,000 on your birthday in 3 months?"</p>
<p><strong>Pick now!</strong> Put it in a savings account earning 3.5% annually, and in 3 months you'd have roughly ₹5,044.</p>
</div>

<div class="example-card">
<h4>Example 2: Starting to Save Early</h4>
<p><strong>Scenario A:</strong> Start saving at age 20, ₹1,000/month for 10 years, then stop.</p>
<p><strong>Scenario B:</strong> Start at age 30, save for 25 years.</p>
<p><strong>Result?</strong> Scenario A often ends up with MORE money because early money had more time to grow. This is compound growth!</p>
</div>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-comparison.jpg.png" alt="Saving Comparison">

<h2>The Formula Behind the Magic</h2>

<img src="blog-images/tvm-compound.jpg.png" alt="Compound Growth">

<div class="formula">Future Money = Today's Money × (1 + Growth Rate)^Years</div>

<div class="example-card">
<h4>💡 Example Calculation</h4>
<p><strong>Today:</strong> ₹10,000 | <strong>Growth:</strong> 5% | <strong>Time:</strong> 2 years</p>
<p>Future Money = ₹10,000 × (1.05)² = ₹10,000 × 1.1025 = <strong>₹11,025</strong></p>
<p>That extra ₹1,025 came from nothing but TIME and growth!</p>
</div>

<h2>Why This Matters for Your Life</h2>

<p><strong>For Saving:</strong> If someone offers you ₹10,000 today or next year, pick today and put it in a savings account.</p>

<p><strong>For Borrowing:</strong> Pay your debts fast. The longer you owe, the more it costs you.</p>

<p><strong>For Investing:</strong> Start NOW, not "next year." Even ₹500 invested today grows significantly over decades.</p>

<p><strong>For Decisions:</strong> Ask yourself: "What could this money do if I invested it instead?"</p>

<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

<div class="tip-box">
<p><strong>₹1 today is worth more than ₹1 tomorrow.</strong> Because of inflation, opportunity cost, and risk.</p>
</div>

<p>Understanding this helps you make smarter decisions about saving, spending, and investing. It's why rich people start early, why banks charge interest, and why waiting costs you real money.</p>

<h3>Your Turn</h3>
<p>Think about a decision you've delayed—like starting to save or investing your first ₹1,000. Imagine how much it could grow if you started today instead of waiting 5 years.</p>
<p><strong>That difference? That's Time Value of Money working against you.</strong></p>
